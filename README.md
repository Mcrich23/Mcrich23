My name is Morris.

I love making apps, writing python scripts and exploring other's projects. I always want to make this world better, and this is my hobby.
  
I am currently in high school at The Northwest School, and am 14. I have developed some apps such as [Jokes Are Us](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jokes-are-us/id1557776302). I'm also an amazing, innovative older brother. I am also looking for testers for my app [Pickt](https://mcrich23.com/pickt), it's an app designed to help you and your friends find a place to eat without anyone having to compromise. Make sure to also check out my website [mcrich23.com](https://mcrich23.com).
  
If you want to chat, feel free to reach me through my website.
